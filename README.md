# Rampant
### Benchmark your character and/or modpack

Rampant is a highly-configurable mod that makes monsters gradually more powerful the further you travel from world spawn.

Grab your favorite modpack with all its gear and enchantments and put them to a good use with this mod installed, or demonstrate your mastery in vanilla Minecraft and see how far can you reach without dying.

Rampant is intended to be a complementary mod, and as such aims to maintain a high level of mod compatibility. If you encounter bugs, please report them to the issue tracker.
